Description: simple Xfce oriented text editor
 Mousepad is a graphical text editor for Xfce based on Leafpad.

 following features:
   * Complete support for UTF-8 text
   * Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text
   * Search and Replace
   * Font selection

   * Manual code-set setting
   * Infinite Undo/Redo by word
   * Auto Indent
   * Multi-line Indent
   * Display line numbers
   * Drag and Drop
